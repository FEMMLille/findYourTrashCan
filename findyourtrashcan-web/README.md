## DÃ©veloppement

Before beginning to developp, you'll have to install node js and npm. Here's how :

1. [Node.js][]: Download the latest version from the node js website and install it. It contains both node and npm.
2. (Optionnal) [Yarn][]: You can use Yarn to manage your dependencies if you want.

Then in the current directory run :

    npm install

Or if you have installed Yarn :

    yarn install

Then run :
    npm start

Or with Yarn :
    yarn start

You will have to start the [backend][] server to be able to work !

Then you will be able to access the frontend with [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) (or [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) if you are in production mode).
